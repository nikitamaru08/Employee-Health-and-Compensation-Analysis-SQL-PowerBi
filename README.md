# Employee-Health-and-Compensation-Analysis-SQL-PowerBi

This repository presents an in-depth analysis of employee health and compensation, with the primary objective of optimizing HR decisions and promoting employee well-being. The project combines data integration and visualization techniques to derive actionable insights from multiple datasets.

## Project Highlights
  **Problem Statement:** The project aimed to identify the healthiest employees for a bonus program and optimize compensation for non-smokers while adhering to a strict budget.

  **Tools and Techniques:** SQL with left joins was used to harmonize three datasets, while filtering criteria were applied to identify non-smokers and segment employees based on Body 
    Mass Index (BMI). A Power BI dashboard was created for interactive data visualization.

  **Key Findings:**
   - Successful identification of eligible candidates for the bonus program, contributing to employee well-being and motivation.
   - Effective optimization of compensation for non-smokers, aligning with budgetary constraints and cost-efficiency goals.
   - Creation of an interactive Power BI dashboard for visualizing and presenting insights to enhance HR decision-making.

## Repository Contents
